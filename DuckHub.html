							<h1>Server Multiplayer Solutions</h1>

							<p>First of all, I wanted the game to be as accessible as possible, so my main requirements for the game were:</p>
						    <li> <b>No download required</b>: Playable direclty in the browser.</li>
							<li> <b>No peer to peer</b>: Players can connect anytime to a server I'm hosting.</li>
							<li> <b>Real time multiplayer</b>: connected players could see actions performed by others in real time, to interact with each other.</li>
							<p>This is my first working on a real time server based multiplayer game, and I decided to do so on a new engine as an added learning experience.</p>
							
							<h2>Multiplayer synchronizer</h2>

							<p>First approach I tried was using Godot's built in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html">Multiplayer Synchronizer</a>, which would handle a lot of the player's movement and spawning synchronization, but the solution only worked on peer to peer connections.</p>

							<h2>ENet Multiplayer Peer</h2>

							<p>Then I tried using <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_enetmultiplayerpeer.html">ENetMultiplayerPeer</a> as peer of Godot's multiplayer's interface.
								This solution uses <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/index.html">ENet</a>, which is a UDP connection library.</p>

							<p><b> UPD </b> connections are perfect to handle movement packets since it's not necessary to receive all of them reliably and if packets are missing, I can always <b>interpolate the existing data</b> to fill in the missing data.
								Everything worked well on regular builds, but when I tried to build for web, my client couldn't connect to the server anymore.</p>

							<h1>Mixed Content in Browsers</h1>

							<p>The reason why my clients couldn't connect to the my servers with ENetMultiplayerPeer is because the server is hosted on an <b>Unsecured HTTP connection</b>.
								Whenever a website that is hosted in a secured HHTPS connection, tries to load media from an unsecured one, that is called <b><a href="https://web.dev/articles/what-is-mixed-content">Mixed Content</a></b> and modern browsers will try to block those for security reasons.</p>
								
							<p>This was exactly what was happening when I hosted my game on <b>Itch.io</b>, that is loaded over a secured connection, but tries to connect to my own unsecured server hosted on AWS.</p>

							<h1>SSL Certificates</h1>

							<p>The user could manually permit the data by allowing mixed content on their browsers, but that would go against my accessibility requirement.
								What was left to do then was to secure the Server with an <b>SSL Certificate</b>.</p>
							<p>I used <b><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letsencrypt</a></b> to certify my self-signed certification and brough it over my client and server code.
								I then changed my connection into <b><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_websocketpeer.html">WebSocketPeer</a></b> instead of ENetMultiplayerPeer since UDP wouldn't be able to encrypt and decrypt packets by nature being an unreliable connection.</p>

							<h1>Architecture</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ServerArchitecture.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h1>Dedicated Server</h1>
							<h2>Server Synchronization</h2>

							<p>Clients and Server communicate through <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPCs</a></b> and standard interpolations is implemented to smoothen out client's movements.</p>
							<p>Each time a player performs an action, an RPC is sent to the server that replicates the world state and sends the information of the current world state to every connected client, so that everyone will be notified of each other's changes.</p>

							<h2>Client Interpolation</h2>

							<p>If the server just sends to the client the positions of each agent in the world every server tick, in the client the movement of every other agent would look really <b>jittery</b>, so the movement of those characters need to be interpolated between the current position and the desired position.</p>
							
							<p>Issue is that it's <b>impossible</b> to know what is the desired position of other agents, since that's data that comes from the <b>Future</b>.
								Therefore, in real time games, synchronization is often done by <b>rendering the world state</b> a few milliseconds <b>in the past</b>, so each client can store in a buffer the world states of the next few frames to properly interpolate the movements of every other agent.</p>

							<h2>Clock Synchronization</h2>

							<p>This is only possible when all clocks across server and clients agree on a <b>shared and unique time clock</b> used to determine what is in the past or in the future, so the clients cannot use their local machine's time.</p>

							<p>This sounds trivial but some aspects to take in consideration are:
								<li>Reliable time must come from the server</li>
								<li>Clients cannot just use the server time they receive since lag delay must be taken into consideration</li>
								<li>The delay can vary across the frames, so we need to find the average delay across a certain timeframe while also eliminating outlier lag spikes that might corrupt the average delay value</li></p>
